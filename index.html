        <p>How might we predict future staples (i.e. Wheat, Rice, and Potatoes) consumption patterns in various Asian countries based on median age, Gross Domestic Product (GDP) per capita, Human Development Index (HDI) and Price of staples in order to inform planning of future farming needs to ensure food security in the region?

        <p>
          Out of the various food staples, we narrowed our options to rice, wheat and potato. Firstly, over 90% of the world's rice is produced and consumed in Asia. Next, from bread to pasta, wheat is an unavoidable staple that everyone around the world consumes on a near daily basis. Finally, potato is a vital food-security crop and substitute for cereal crop considering its high yield and nutritional value. We then randomly chose different countries in the Asia region and classify them into their economies:

      <ol>
        <li><p>Least Developed Country: Myanmar, Laos</p></li>
        <li><p>Developing Country: China, Thailand, Indonesia, Philippines, India, Pakistan</p></li>
        <li><p>Developed Country: Israel, Japan</p></li>
      </ol>

        <p>Food and Agricultural Organisation (FAO) provides a useful and publicly available source of granular data suitable for the study of staple consumption behaviour. We selected staple consumption per capita as an indicator for the consumption pattern in a target country.</p>

          <p>We collected data for our predictor variables from a variety of sources such as World Bank Open Data, Global Data Lab and World Bank Commodity Prices. Our dataset used in the training of our multiple linear regression model contains: (a) Consumption of staples per capita (e.g., rice, wheat, potato) covering a 30 year period from 1990 to 2019 , (b) HDI data of target countries in Asia (e.g, China, India, Myanmar, etc.), (c) Global prices of staples from 1990-2019, (d) GDP per capita of target countries in Asia from 1990 to 2019 and (e) Median age of target countries in Asia from 1990 to 2019.

        <h2 class="section-title2">Big <span>Picture</span></h2>
        <p>
          We want to model the consumption proportions of each staple crop in Asian countries, hence we will build 3 multiple linear regression models to predict the consumption proportions, giving us a total of 24 linear regression models. We will use dictionaries to store the processed data at each stage of our building process, including the preparation of features and targets as well as the training of our models to obtain the optimal coefficients.

          <h2 class="section-title2">Features <span>Used</span></h2>
          <p>
          GDP per capita - we assume that this is proportionate to the people's disposable income, which might influence the people's food choices.<br/>
          Median age - we hypothesise that different age group may have different preferences towards each type of staple food.<br/>
          Human Devopment Index (HDI) - this data tells us about the capabilities of a country's citizens, which may or may not diversify their food choices.<br/>
          Rice/Wheat/Potato price - we think that food price is a factor of the buying decisions made by the people when it comes to food.<br/>
          <br/>
          We used rice/wheat/potato consumption proportions as targets. They are obtained by calculating the proportion of each staple crop consumed out of the total amount of crops consumed. The consumption quantities are based on the supply quantities of each crop. We also assumed that rice, wheat and potato are the only crops consumed by each country.<br/>
          <br/>
          For each country, we prepared 3 sets of features and targets for each country, each corresponding to one of the 3 staple crops, as we intend to build one multiple linear regression model for one crop type.

        <h2 class="section-title2">Evalu<span>a</span>tion</h2>
        <p>
          We used adjusted R<sup>2</sup> and mean squared error as metrics to evaluate the accuracy of our models.<br/>

          Adjusted R<sup>2</sup> is a modified version of R<sup>2</sup> where the number of predictors are taken into account, hence it would result in more accurate decisions as to whether or not a regression model is reliable. We decided that an R<sup>2</sup> value of around or greater than 0.6 would indicate a sufficiently accurate model.
        </p>
        <p>
          Mean squared error is the mean of squared differences between the predicted values and the actual values. 
        </p>
        <p>
          Mean absolute error is the mean of the magnitude of absolute errors of the predicted values.
